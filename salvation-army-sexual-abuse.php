                <h1>Sexual Abuse in Salvation Army</h1>     
                <p class="typeset">
At JVW we have successfully resolved several claims of sexual abuse against The Salvation Army dealing with childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by its Majors and Captains within the Army.   While the Salvation Army has certainly done more than some of the other religious organizations to prevent abuse today, in the past, the Salvation Army was also a haven for pedophiles.
