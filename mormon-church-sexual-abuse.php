                <h1>Sexual Abuse in Mormon Church</h1>             
                <p class="typeset">
                The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka The Mormon Church) has a unique culture that can unwittingly provide a haven for sexual abusers. Unfortunately, just like other insular religions, the Latter Day Saints leaders have not brought known abusers to justice, and even cover up the abusers' crimes. Instead of reporting sexual abuse to civil and criminal authorities, all to often Mormon bishops and stake presidents have handled all allegations internally.  In so doing, and with an eye toward protecting the image of the Church, they strongly discourage intervention by outside authorities. 
                <br><br>
                Church leaders often cover up or turn a blind eye to evidence of child sexual abuse and attempt to deal with pedophilia exclusively as a matter of sin and not as a crime or a grave threat to children and families. LDS Church General Authorities in Utah have known of the wide spread nature of this problem but continue to deny it and refuse to implement meaningful reforms that can better protect LDS children.   
                <br><br>
                At JVW we are currently involved in lawsuits against the Mormon Church in Hawaii.  As part of these lawsuits, we are seeking non monetary relief to include implementing policies and procedures that protect children from sexual abuse rather than protecting the Church.  This includes mandatory reporting to criminal and civil authorities upon learning of a credible sexual abuse allegation.  Unfortunately, the current policies direct reporters to bishops and stake presidents who then report to the Church's internal legal department for further instruction.  Dealing with abuse "In-House" like the Mormon Church has done, protects the Church, but it does little to protect children or provide justice for survivors.
