                            <h1>Serving victims of sexual abuse <span>and clergy abuse throughout the United States.</span></h1>

                            At James, Vernon & Weeks, P.A. we are committed to standing up for the rights of survivors of childhood sexual abuse and offer confidential, passionate, yet aggressive legal representation. Leander L. James and Craig K. Vernon are dedicated to the legal battle against childhood sexual abuse.   
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Sex abuse thrives in secrecy.</strong> <br>
                            Institutions that foster secrecy and even cover up sex abuse crimes are the reason why it was so prevalent in the past and continues to this day. At James, Vernon & Weeks, P.A. we are dedicated advocates for our clients and believe strongly that taking legal action can help change religious and other institutions that have a history of covering up allegations of sexual misconduct. With offices in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Seattle, Washington, we handle sexual abuse claims regionally and throughout the nation.  
                            <br><br>
                            Child predators count on silence and secrecy so they can continue to sexually abuse kids. Children, who are far too young to make decisions or even comprehend the acts perpetrated against then are lured or forced into sexual activity by predatory adults. Many survivors will suffer long terms emotional and psychological damages. At James, Vernon & Weeks, we recognize and understand these sensitive issues.    
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>When it is time to end the silence, we can help.</strong> <br>
                            Survivors that come forward and speak up help expose the truth and by so doing protect kids from being abused in the future. What happened was not your fault, and you are not alone. We recognize that each survivor has his or her own unique healing process. Confidentiality and privacy are of utmost importance. Your privacy will be respected and most often we are able to keep confidential your identity as we work through the legal process together.

                            <br><br>
