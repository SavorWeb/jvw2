                <h1>Boy Scout Sexual Abuse</h1>                
                <p>
                In the 1920s, the Boy Scouts of America started keeping a list of men who they wanted to keep out of Scouting, including men who had been accused of acts of "perversion" with children.  When an adult volunteered to become a Scout leader, his name was checked to see if it was on the list.  By 1935, the list contained more than 2,919 men who the Boy Scouts declared unfit to volunteer in Scouts.

                While this system kept many sexual predators out of Scouting once their abuse of a child was disclosed, the Boy Scouts did nothing to warn children or their parents that literally thousands of men were volunteering with Scouts in order to molest children.  Or perhaps more importantly, how they were using their position in Scouts to groom children, isolate them from their families, and abuse them.
