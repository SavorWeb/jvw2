                <h1>Sexual Abuse in Catholic Church</h1> 
                <p class="typeset">
                The Catholic sex abuse crisis is well known and documented through countless news stories covering this tragedy. Yet despite the overwhelming evidence of sexual abuse by its Priests, the Catholic Church continues in its attempt to cover up the crimes of sexual predators. These self-serving, dangerous practices of cover up, in order to protect the Church, only enable abusers to continue terrorizing children. 
                <br><br>
                We believe that lawsuits against the Catholic Church can impact policy and force positive change.  When pedophile priests are revealed, they can be prevented from ever committing child sexual abuse again.  Another objective of a lawsuit is to require the Church, which has enabled child sexual abuse to occur, to change its ways so that fewer children are victims of sexual abuse in the future.
                <br><br>
                At JVW we have Catholic clergy abuse survivors and fought to PROTECT children from the horror of sexual abuse by publicly identifying sexual predators in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Hawaii, New Jersey, Montana, Idaho, Washington and Oregon.  We are currently involved in pending cases against the Catholic Church is the states of Montana, Wisconsin, Hawaii and Minnesota.   </p>
