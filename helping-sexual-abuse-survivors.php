                        <h1>Helping Sexual Abuse Survivors</h1>
                        <p>
                            As a client of our firm, you can be confident that you are in the hands of skilled, knowledgeable and caring professionals. Our firm has been advocating passionately on behalf of injured clients since 1982. 
                            <br><br>
                            Our firm has developed a reputation for skilled advocacy in sexual abuse claims. We have obtained many significant recoveries on behalf of sexual abuse survivors. We have taken on several religious institutions, the Boy Scouts of America and other prominent organizations. Attorney Leander James, a managing partner at our firm, negotiated a $166 million settlement on behalf of hundreds of sexual abuse survivors in a case against the Northwest Jesuits.
                            <br><br>
                            We realize it is difficult to reach out for help. Some of our clients have reached out to us before they have shared their history of abuse with close friends or family members. We realize these are difficult matters to discuss, and we are here to help.

                            Are you a victim of childhood sex abuse? Have you struggled with any of the following? 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Guilt, feelings that it was your fault</li>
                                <li>Anger (toward yourself, your abuser, others who should have known or stopped the abuse) </li>
                                <li>Self-hatred, self-blame</li> 
                                <li>Criminal behavior, self-destructive behavior </li>
                                <li>Alcohol or drug abuse </li>
                                <li>Isolation </li>
                                <li>Anxiety </li>
                                <li>Flashbacks, repressing memories, post-traumatic stress </li>
                                <li>Fear, avoidance of intimacy </li>
                                <li>Inability to sustain meaningful relationships, inability to function </li>
                                <li>Insomnia, difficulty concentrating </li>
                            </ul>
                            We've helped hundreds of victims of childhood sex abuse. Over the years, we've come to recognize the signs. The trauma of childhood sex abuse can leave emotional scars that last for years after the abuse has ended. We see courageous survivors push ahead into adulthood, only to find their lives falling apart at some point. Many turn to alcohol or drugs to deaden the pain. Some turn to crime. Many are unable to sustain meaningful relationships or hold a job. Sometimes, so-called over-achievers try to bury the pain of the past in constant work.
                            <br><br>
                            If you're a survivor of childhood sex abuse, it wasn't your fault. And you're not alone. There is help. We offer the legal tools to help survivors get justice and secure compensation for their injuries. We seek change by holding abusers and their protectors accountable.

                        <h1>How You Can Fight Back</h1>
                        <p>
                            If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, you have a right to hold your abuser accountable for his or her actions.  Our offices have helped sexual abuse clients to PROTECT children from the horror of sexual abuse by publicly identifying sexual predators in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Hawaii, New Jersey, Montana, Idaho and Washington.
                            <br><br>
                            We have worked with hundreds of sexual abuse survivors for over a decade to achieve HEALING and HEALTH while regaining their power by prosecuting their lawsuits.  Most survivors of sexual abuse have tried to put the abuse behind them and, in the process, run from the memories of the sexual abuse.  A civil lawsuit provides the opportunity for the survivor to stop running, turn around and run at these painful memories, taking away their power.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Is my call confidential?</strong> <br>
                            Yes. We realize it is difficult to reach out for help. Some of our clients have reached out to us before they have shared their history of abuse with close friends or family members. We realize these are difficult matters to discuss, and we are here to help. We are pleased to offer a free and confidential consultation to answer your questions and help you understand your rights.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Is it too late for me?</strong> <br>
                            It depends on your age when you finally confront your memories of abuse. In many states, however, strict statutes of limitation control whether a lawsuit may be filed. Each situation must be evaluated carefully before any legal advice can be given.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Do I qualify to file Suit?</strong> <br>
                            Each potential case is different with different facts.  Your situation must be evaluated carefully before any legal advice can be given.

                        <h1>Stand Against Those Who Protect Perpetrators</h1>  
                        <p>
                            Even after the many recent news stories uncovering child sexual abuse in Catholic churches, many institutions have policies of covering up and excusing incidents of sex abuse. Many organizations try to deal with sexual abusers "in-house" instead of turning them into authorities. These self-serving, dangerous practices only enable abusers to continue terrorizing children.
                            <br><br>
                            Our attorneys have spent years going after institutions that protect sexual abusers of children.  They have represented hundreds of abused people against the following organizations:
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Boy Scouts</li>
                                <li>Catholic Dioceses</li>
                                <li>Mormon Church</li>
                            </ul>
                            <br>
                            None of these organizations encourages their members to sexually abuse children. But all have been found to consistently fail to act on allegations of abuse, shuffle abusers to different locations, and prevent incidents from becoming public. By covering up their crimes, these institutions are guilty of allowing sexual abusers to continue destroying people's lives.
