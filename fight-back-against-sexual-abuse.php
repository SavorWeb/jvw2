    If you are a survivor of sexual abuse, you have a right to hold your abuser accountable for his or her actions.  Our offices have helped sexual abuse clients to PROTECT children from the horror of sexual abuse by publicly identifying sexual predators in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Hawaii, New Jersey, Montana, Idaho and Washington.
    <br><br>
     We have worked with hundreds of sexual abuse survivors for over a decade to achieve HEALING and HEALTH while regaining their power by prosecuting their lawsuits.  Most survivors of sexual abuse have tried to put the abuse behind them and, in the process, run from the memories of the sexual abuse.  A civil lawsuit provides the opportunity for the survivor to stop running, turn around and run at these painful memories, taking away their power.
