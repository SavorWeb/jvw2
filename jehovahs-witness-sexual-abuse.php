                For child members of a close-knit religious organization like the Jehovah's Witnesses reporting a crime of sexual abuse is difficult if not practically impossible.   In this religious group, like many others, the members form a detached and isolated group, essentially cutting the victims off from the outside world should abuse occur.
                <br><br>
                Due to church policy, sexual abuse is often ignored, and should an allegation be made, it is often either covered up or decried as unfounded. The Jehovah's Witnesses practice what is known as a "two witness" rule – which is allegedly used to help work against the possibility of a false accusation. This rule is said to be based off the group's interpretation of Deuteronomy 19:15 and 1 Timothy 5:19; it requires that an accusation of sexual abuse be backed by at least two witnesses
                <br><br>
                By mainly dealing with the accusations internally, they rarely turn over a sexual offender to criminal and civil authorities. This not only leaves victims vulnerable – it leaves the offender unpunished and essentially free to abuse again.
