                <h1>Clergy Abuse in Other Religious Institutions</h1>      
                <p>
                Even after the many recent news stories uncovering child sexual abuse in Catholic churches, many institutions have policies of covering up and excusing incidents of sex abuse and clergy abuse. Many organizations try to deal with sexual abusers "in-house" instead of turning them into authorities. These self-serving, dangerous practices only enable abusers to continue terrorizing children.
                <br><br>
                None of these organizations encourages their members to sexually abuse children. But all have been found to consistently fail to act on allegations of abuse, shuffle abusers to different locations, and prevent incidents from becoming public. By covering up their crimes, these institutions are guilty of allowing sexual abusers to continue destroying people's lives.
