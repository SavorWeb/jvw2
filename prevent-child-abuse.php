                <h1>Stand Against Those Who Protect Perpetrators</h1>  
                <p class="typeset">
                Even after the many recent news stories uncovering child sexual abuse in Catholic churches, many institutions have policies of covering up and excusing incidents of sex abuse. Many organizations try to deal with sexual abusers "in-house" instead of turning them into authorities. These self-serving, dangerous practices only enable abusers to continue terrorizing children.
                <br><br>
                Our attorneys have spent years going after institutions that protect sexual abusers of children.  They have represented hundreds of abused people against the following organizations:
                <br>
                <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Boy Scouts</li>
                        <li>Catholic Dioceses</li>
                        <li>Mormon Church</li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                None of these organizations encourages their members to sexually abuse children. But all have been found to consistently fail to act on allegations of abuse, shuffle abusers to different locations, and prevent incidents from becoming public. By covering up their crimes, these institutions are guilty of allowing sexual abusers to continue destroying people's lives.
